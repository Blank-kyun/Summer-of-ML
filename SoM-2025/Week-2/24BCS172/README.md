Week 2 :
    In Week 2 of SoMâ€™25, I learned how to clean and prepare data by handling missing values, fixing outliers, and working with categories. I explored the basics of Machine Learning (ML), including the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. The week focused on two main ML models: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. I learned how these models work, how to train them, and how to measure their performance. I also did hands-on practice with and without using ML libraries like Scikit-learn. A quiz and assignment helped test my understanding.

Topics :
    1.Exploratory Data Analysis
    2.Linear Regression(from scratch and using scikit-learn)
    3.Logical Regression
