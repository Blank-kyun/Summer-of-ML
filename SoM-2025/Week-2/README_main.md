# Linear Regression - Week 2 Graded Assignment

This repository contains the Week 2 graded assignment for Linear Regression, developed as part of a machine learning course. The goal of this notebook is to help learners implement and visualize the fundamentals of linear regression from scratch using Python.

## 📘 Notebook Summary

The notebook walks through:

- Introduction to linear regression
- Loading and visualizing data
- Cost function implementation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Predictive modeling using trained parameters
- Plotting the regression line

The assignment helps reinforce understanding by letting users:

- Implement core algorithms manually (e.g., cost function, gradient descent)
- Use `numpy` and `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for computation and visualization
- Compare predictions with actual data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 File Structure

- `Week_2.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all exercises and visualizations

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook
2. Open it using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), Jupyter Notebook, or VSCode
3. Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
4. Run each cell step-by-step to follow along

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure `%matplotlib inline` is used to embed plots correctly in Jupyter environments.
- All code is written to be beginner-friendly and includes inline comments for clarity.
