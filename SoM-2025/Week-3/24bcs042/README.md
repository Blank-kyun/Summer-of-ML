## üìÅ Project Title: Spaceship Titanic - Alternate Dimension Prediction

This is a machine learning project built around the **Spaceship Titanic** dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to predict which passengers were teleported to another dimension during a cosmic event. The task uses various classification models, primarily focusing on **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [Google Drive CSV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sbQ5WJ-KCPBrhT2YagtaARGoujCMpB8Q/view)
- **Records**: ~13,000 passengers
- **Features**: Includes passenger ID, home planet, cryo-sleep status, destination, cabin, age, and more.
- **Target**: `Transported` (Binary: True/False)

## üéØ Objective

Build a classification model to accurately predict if a passenger was **transported** to an alternate dimension.
